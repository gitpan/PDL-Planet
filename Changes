Revision history for Perl extension PDL::Planet
0.01  01/21/2003
	- original version

0.04  03/03/2005
        - Updated build procedure to work on AMD-64.
        Must export CPPFLAGS='-fPIC' before building.
0.05  10/18/2005
        - Fixed small bug in AMD 64 detection for multi-threaded perl.

0.06  4/06/2006
        - Added new 1000x2000 earth image derived from a GMT altimetry plot
        - Added a maskColor option to the 'paste' subroutine so that
          a glyph with a black backround can be blended.
	- Added -O3 optimization to util.c.  This helps a little
          with aform_orthographic times.

0.07  5/16/2006
        - Added support for drawing the Earth's terminator:
          - the SUNPOS option to 'transform' takes the sun's
            lat/lon and shows the terminator
          - the SUNTIME option to 'transform' takes the julian time
            and uses the 'spa' package from NREL (included) to compute the sun's lat/lon
            then plotting the terminator
0.08  6/22/2006
         - Added a routine to display a day/night terminator on a linear plot.
0.09  11/16/2006
         - Added monthly earth images
0.10  3/21/2007
         - Added 3 more earth images - Maggie
0.11  1/14/2009
         - Removed -lg2c from LIBS in Makefile.PL.  This allows package to work for CentOS 5.2.
           With the change it still seems to work with CentOS 4, both 32 and 64 bit platforms.
0.12  9/9/2009
         - Added write_png function which creates an in-memory PNG in a perl scalar.  Handy
           for web applications.  Created two low-level functions write_png_mem and write_png_mem1
           which demonstrate two different ways of doing this.
